# plan-the-man
A work calendar app to help you plan your day.

This app utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and MomentJS.

Don't lose track of your workday responsibilities, write them down instead:
Just write your task in the corresponding time block and hit save! When you've completed your tasks for the day, clear your list with the "Clear Calendar" button!

Working on this app allowed me to practice JavaScript as well as get a better understanding of JQuery, Bootstrap, and MomentJS.
